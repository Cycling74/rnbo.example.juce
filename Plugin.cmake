# `juce_add_plugin` adds a static library target with the name passed as the first argument
# (RNBOAudioPlugin here). This target is a normal CMake target, but has a lot of extra properties set
# up by default. As well as this shared code static library, this function adds targets for each of
# the formats specified by the FORMATS arguments. This function accepts many optional arguments.
# Check the readme at `docs/CMake API.md` in the JUCE repo for the full list.

# that will be built into the target. This is a standard CMake command.
